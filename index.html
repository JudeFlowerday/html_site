<h1><b>Hi, I'm Judith Flowerday and Welcome to my GitHub Page ! </b></h1>

<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
<h3><u>Personal Details</u></h3>

I live in Dromore, Northern Ireland.  Here are a few pictures of Dromore <a href="https://www.expedia.co.uk/Dromore.dx6134355">Visit Dromore</a>

I'm 56 years old, married to Philip and I've three Cocker Spaniel children - Molly, Alfie and Abi

<h3><u>Education</u></h3>

I'm a CIMA-qualified accountant with an MBA in International Business with French and Spanish, although there's not much call for any language other than 'Norn Iron' here !

<h3><u>Employment</u></h3>

I've worked in Marketing for easyJet and Jet2 and as an accountant in various guises for a number of years, after retraining and studying for my CIMA exams.
I've worked in treasury management, decision-support analysis and now technical accounting with my current employer, IQ-EQ.
IQ-EQ is set to become one of the largest accounting service providers for private equity funds investing in all types of assets - from real estate and infrastructure
through debt finance and more typical private company acquisition and development.

<h3><u>My goals</u></h3>

The through-line in all the jobs I've had has been data analysis, but this field and education weren't around when I was in my 20s.  If I had the opportunity to do it
all again, I'd have studied statistics and data analytics.  For now, I'm trying to retrain in data analytics as I'd love to work on into my 70s if possible and
would live to be doing analytical work for as long as I can - likely on a freelance basis.  I've reset my goal with this course, just to learn as much as I can and then practice, practice
and more practice !  You can see that my current skill doesn't extend to using the Portfolio Jekyll Theme template - I tried for several hours but failed.  That said, I could
never even have done this much at Christmas last year, so I'm very grateful !

<h3><u>Personal interests</u></h3>

I love reading, especially Christian books as I find they help me try to apply my faith to real life nowadays.  I love keeping fit - especially walking, running and swimming and I'd love to
always have dogs in my life.

Thanks for reading this page - hope y ou enjoyed this small insight into this old girl's life !
